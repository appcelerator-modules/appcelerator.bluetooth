name: Modules.Bluetooth
summary: Allows a Titanium application to use Bluetooth service.
description: |
    The module is used for connecting your application via bluetooth.

    <p class="note">Note: This feature requires a Pro or Enterprise subscription. More infos <a href="https://www.appcelerator.com/pricing/" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>

    ### Getting Started
    - Add the module as a dependency to your application by adding a **`<module>`** item to the
      **`<modules>`** element of your `tiapp.xml` file:
      ``` xml
      <ti:app>
        <!-- ... -->
        <modules>
          <module platform="android">appcelerator.bluetooth</module>
        </modules>
        <!-- ... -->
      </ti:app>
      ```
    - Use `require()` to access the module from JavaScript:
      ``` javascript
      var bluetooth = require('appcelerator.bluetooth');
      ```
    - The `bluetooth` variable is a reference to the module. Make API calls using this reference:
      ``` javascript
      bluetooth.isSupported();
      ```
    - Add the following `uses-permission` element to the Android manifest section of the tiapp.xml
        file. You may need to add the `manifest elements.
        ``` xml
        <ti:app>
            <android xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
                <manifest>
                    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
                    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" />
                    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/> 
                </manifest>
            </android>
        </ti:app>
        ```

methods: 
  - name: cancelDiscovery
    summary: Cancels the current device discovery process.
    description: |
        As discovery is a heavyweight procedure for the Bluetooth adapter, this method should
        always be called before attempting to connect to a remote device via [connect](Modules.Bluetooth.BluetoothSocket.connect).
        Discovery is run as a system service, so an application should always call cancel discovery
        even if it did not directly request a discovery, just to be sure. If Bluetooth state is not
        [STATE_ON](Modules.Bluetooth.STATE_ON) or if there is no ongoing discovery process this
        function will return false. Listen for the [discoveryFinished](Modules.Bluetooth.discoveryFinished)

  - name: startDiscovery
    summary: Starts the remote device discovery process.
    description: |
        This method starts the discovery for the nearby Bluetooth devices. The process of the discovery
        takes upto 12 seconds.This is an asynchronous call, it will return immediately. Register for
        [discoveryStarted](Modules.Bluetooth.discoveryStarted) and [discoveryFinished](Modules.Bluetooth.discoveryFinished)
        events to determine exactly when discovery starts and completes. Register for [deviceFound](Modules.Bluetooth.deviceFound)
        event to be notified when a nearby device is found. From API level 29 and above make sure
        that the location services is on in the device to start the scanning process. Device discovery
        will only find remote devices that are currently in discoverable mode. Many Bluetooth devices
        are not discoverable by default, and need to be entered into a discoverable mode. This method may
        return same device multiple times from the `deviceFound` event in span of 12 seconds.
